== Description ==

CP Reservation Calendar is a booking calendar that allows selecting dates - ex: check-in and check-out dates - for a reservation. 

= Main Features: =

This **booking calendar** can be used for hotel bookings, tour bookings, car rentals, office rentals, jewels rentals, cellphone rentals, etc. It's **integrated with PayPal** for receiving the reservation payments and has many other features (details below).

The reservation calendar can be configured in two modes: "complete day" or "partial day" bookings. *Complete day* means that the first and the last days booked are charged as full days while *Partial Day* means that they are charged as half-days only. Partial Day system is widely used by hotels and car rental systems: the customer is charged half a daily rate for both the arrival/pick-up day and the departure/drop-off day, thereby matching the number of nights actually spent in the hotel or the 24 hour days using the service.
